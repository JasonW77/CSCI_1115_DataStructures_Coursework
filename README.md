CSCI 1115 DataStructures Coursework.

this repository contains my coursework for CSCI 1115 - Algorithms and Data Structures at Southwest Tech.

I am using this repository to save my assignments, as well as to use those assignments as a portfolio for future potential employers.

(Bio Goes Here)

I am taking this program because I have always had an aptitude and a keen interest in programing I thought that it was about time that I did something about it. I would love to work as a programmer or at the least be able to create my own programs.
